This repository includes the backend of a full stack web application built as a test project in the interview process at Taurgo. 
The backend part of this site is built with springboot and mongodb.
Four documents are created (in mongodb cluster ) as users, bookings, companies and services in the database to store all the data.
When creating accounts the role is to be selected by the user ( as client, partner or super admin ) and it will be saved in the users document to be accessed when it's needed to identify the user based on role.
